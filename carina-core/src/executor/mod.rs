//! Plan executor - Executes a Plan by dispatching Effects to a Provider.
//!
//! This module contains the core execution logic extracted from the CLI apply command.
//! It uses an `ExecutionObserver` trait for UI separation, allowing the CLI to provide
//! colored progress output while keeping the execution logic testable.
//!
//! ## Module structure
//!
//! - `basic`: Single-effect execution (Create/Update/Delete), resource resolution, binding map
//! - `parallel`: Dependency computation and fine-grained parallel scheduling
//! - `replace`: Replace effect orchestration (CBD and DBD)
//! - `phased`: Interdependent Replace ordering (4-phase execution)
